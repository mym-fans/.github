**What Is MYM FANS?**

MYM is a content subscription platform similar to OnlyFans, primarily popular in French-speaking regions. It allows creators — often models, influencers, or adult performers — to monetize private content through subscriptions, pay-per-view messages, and tips.

While MYM offers a structured ecosystem for content sharing, it comes with one major downside: **a 25% platform fee** on all creator earnings.

**Why Are Creators Looking to Leave?**

The high fees cut into monthly income. For example:
- If you make €4,000, you lose €1,000 in platform commissions
- Add transaction fees, and it can reach 28–30% in deductions
- You have limited ownership over branding and data
- There’s little flexibility in how and where you sell content

This has led many creators and agencies to seek out better alternatives.
